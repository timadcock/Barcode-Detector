# Barcode Detector
## Description:
This is my final project I did for my CSC 414 (Computer Vision) class. It goes through many methods to detect barcodes in an image. The methods and procedures I did for each method are described in the jupyter notebook.

## Usage:
1. Launch jupyter notebooks or something that is similar.
2. Load in Barcode Detector.ipynb
3. Run and read through the extra comments.
